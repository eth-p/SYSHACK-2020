## The Hackamon Company

The Hackamon application is a Discord bot which is the spiritual successor to the wildly popular title "Pokemon Go". The app encourages users to complete annoying tasks at home such as chores by rewarding them with collectable Hackamon.

Users can post bounties which can be completed by other players for Hackachips. These Hackachips can be used to capture potentially rare Hackamons. These Hackamons can be collected and battled against other users on Discord.
